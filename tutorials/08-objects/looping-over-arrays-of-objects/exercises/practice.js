/**** LOOPING OVER ARRAYS OF OBJECTS: PRACTICE ****/

    Practice drilling into array-wrapped data structures to filter

/** EXERCISE 1: ENVIRONMENT CHECKUP **/

const atmosphericScrubbers = [
	{ zone: "Command Deck", filterLifePercent: 88 },
	{ zone: "Engineering Bay", filterLifePercent: 32 },
	{ zone: "Crew Quarters", filterLifePercent: 14 },

/*
    TODO: Use a 'for...of' loop to scan through the 'atmosphericScrubbers' array.
    Inside the loop, check if a scrubber's 'filterLifePercent' is less than 40.
    If it is, log a warning statement using a template literal:
    "MAINTENANCE REQ: [zone] filter core is critically low at [filterLifePercent]%!"

/** EXERCISE 2: INTEL METRIC REPORTING **/

const targetDrones = [
	{ designation: "Drone-Alpha", threatScore: 4 },
	{ designation: "Drone-Beta", threatScore: 9 },
	{ designation: "Drone-Gamma", threatScore: 7 },
];

/*
    TODO: Write a standard 'for' loop using index tracking counters ('i') to scan the list.
    Calculate the average threat score of all targets combined.
    Steps:
    1. Declare a mutable sum variable before the loop.
    2. Add up each drone's threat score inside the loop.
    3. Divide that total sum by 'targetDrones.length' after the loop concludes.
    4. Log the final value using a template literal: "Target grid composite average threat rating: [average]"
